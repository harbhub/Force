# To Do List

Change interface to remove buttons from cards and replace it with a system that makes the entire item clickable.  Actionable items should display a green border or something that denotes that the user can click that item.

Improve the interface so that everything fits well on the screen.

Order the shop cards so that the cards the player can buy appear at the top of the list.

Shop items should use justify-content space-between for styling.  This should put the cost on the left, the name of the card in the middle, and the stock count on the right.
